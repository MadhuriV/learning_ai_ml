### Books

While books might not directly relate to watching videos or reading research papers, they serve as complementary study materials consolidating vast quantities of information concisely. Some recommended NLP books include:

* Jurafsky, Daniel, and James H. Martin. Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition. Pearson Education, 2019.
* Chris Manning, et al. Speech and Language Technology. MIT Press, 2014.
* Goldberg, Yoav. Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing. Morgan Kaufmann, 2017.
* Chollet, Fran√ßois. Deep Learning with JavaScript. Manning, 2018.
* O'Reilly. Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit. O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2014.

By exploring the above resources diligently, you should gain substantial insights into NLP concepts and their practical implementations. Remember always to cross-reference theories presented in lectures or texts with empirical evidence gleaned from relevant research publications. Happy learning!
